# Svelte SSDLC Addendum

This addendum complements the Svelte Best Practices ruleset with Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) guidance, ensuring security and quality are addressed at every stage of development.

---

## 1. Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment
- Perform threat modeling for new features, major changes, or integrations.
- Identify potential attack vectors (e.g., XSS, CSRF, API abuse, data leakage).
- Document security assumptions and mitigations in design docs or issue trackers.
- Use tools like [OWASP Threat Dragon](mdc:https:/owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) or [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](mdc:https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling) for structured analysis.

## 2. Security Testing
- Integrate static code analysis (e.g., ESLint security plugins) into CI pipelines.
- Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, [Snyk](mdc:https:/snyk.io), [Dependabot](mdc:https:/github.com/dependabot)) to detect vulnerable packages.
- Perform regular vulnerability testing of deployed applications (e.g., [OWASP ZAP](mdc:https:/owasp.org/www-project-zap)).
- Write and maintain security-focused tests (e.g., input validation, authentication flows, access control).
- Review and test CORS, CSP, and other security headers.

## 3. Incident Response & Monitoring
- Implement centralized error and security logging (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, or custom solutions).
- Monitor for suspicious activity (e.g., repeated failed logins, unusual API usage).
- Document incident response procedures:
  - How to report a security incident
  - Steps for investigation and remediation
  - Communication plan for affected users
- Regularly review and update incident response plans.

## 4. Data Lifecycle Management
- Define and document data retention and deletion policies for user data.
- Implement secure deletion of sensitive data (e.g., on user account deletion).
- Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Review and document third-party data processors and their security practices.

## 5. Developer Security Training
- Encourage ongoing security training for all developers (e.g., OWASP Top 10, SANS Secure Coding).
- Share security updates, advisories, and lessons learned in team meetings or documentation.
