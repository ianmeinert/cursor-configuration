## Scalability Optimization Rule

### Purpose
Establish standards and best practices to ensure the codebase, architecture, and operations can scale efficiently as the system grows in size, complexity, and user demand.

---

### 1. Service Boundaries and Modularity

- Design for modularity: group related functionality into well-defined modules or packages.
- For large systems, define clear service boundaries and consider microservices for independently deployable components.
- Use the RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) pattern for all service interfaces.
- Avoid tight coupling between modules; use dependency injection and interface abstractions.

---

### 2. Observability

- Implement structured logging (JSON or key-value) for all services and critical operations.
- Integrate distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) for all API endpoints and background jobs.
- Expose application metrics (latency, throughput, error rates) via a /metrics endpoint or compatible middleware.
- Use centralized log and metrics aggregation (e.g., ELK, Prometheus, Grafana) for monitoring and alerting.

---

### 3. Configuration Management

- Store all configuration in environment variables or external configuration files.
- Never hardcode secrets, credentials, or environment-specific values in code.
- Use a configuration management library (e.g., Pydantic Settings, Dynaconf) for loading and validating config.
- Support feature flags and runtime configuration for gradual rollouts and A/B testing.

---

### 4. API Versioning

- Version all public API endpoints using a clear, consistent scheme (e.g., /api/v1/resource).
- Never introduce breaking changes to existing API versions; deprecate old versions with clear timelines.
- Document all API versions and changes in the API documentation.
- Use automated contract testing to ensure backward compatibility.

---

### 5. Horizontal Scaling and Statelessness

- Design all services to be stateless; store session or user state in external stores (e.g., Redis, database).
- Ensure the application can run with multiple worker processes (e.g., Uvicorn/Gunicorn with FastAPI).
- Use health check endpoints for readiness and liveness probes in orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes).
- Document scaling procedures and resource requirements for each service.

---

### 6. Performance and Resource Optimization

- Use async I/O for all network and database operations.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed or static data (e.g., Redis, in-memory).
- Batch or chunk large data operations to avoid resource exhaustion.
- Profile and monitor performance regularly; optimize bottlenecks as needed.

---

### 7. Documentation and Maintenance

- Document all scalability-related design decisions and operational procedures.
- Keep scaling, configuration, and deployment documentation up to date.
- Review scalability practices regularly as the system evolves.
